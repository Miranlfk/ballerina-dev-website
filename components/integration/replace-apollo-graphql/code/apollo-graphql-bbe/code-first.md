title: "Ballerina is code-first"
description: "Ballerina GraphQL's code-first approach eliminates the need for a predefined schema. With a syntax similar to GraphQL, developers can define the schema and resolvers directly in code, enabling automatic schema generation. This streamlines development, enhances productivity, and offers flexibility in building efficient and self-contained GraphQL services."
