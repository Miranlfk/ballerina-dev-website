title: 'Enrich data with flexible typing'
description: In a data-oriented program, enriching data with calculated fields is quite common. Ballerinaâ€™s type system allows you to add record fields on the fly, using the bracket notation, like in a dynamically-typed language. This is a very useful feature when you need to enrich data with calculated fields. <br>In Java, you need to create a new strucutre to represent the enriched data.
