title: 'JSON and XML Support'
description: Ballerina has native support for working with JSON and XML data formats. It provides specialized types and built-in operators to handle these data structures. By abstracting the complexities of working with JSON and XML, Ballerina promotes data separation by providing high-level abstractions for data manipulation.
