title: 'Union Types'
description: In data-oriented programming, data can come in various formats or have different underlying types. <br>Union types enable developers to define data structures that can hold values of different types. This flexibility allows for the representation of diverse data formats within a unified structure, making it easier to work with heterogeneous data.
